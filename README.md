# EmotionRecognitionProject
This repository contains a MATLAB-based implementation for emotion recognition using a synthetic dataset combining facial features and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data. The project uses machine learning techniques, specifically a Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify six primary emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, and Neutral. The dataset is generated using MATLAB and is used to train, test, and evaluate the classification model. The project demonstrates how multimodal features can be effectively fused for emotion recognition, with results visualized using confusion matrices.
